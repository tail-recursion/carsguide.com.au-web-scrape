The data I originally wanted was fuel economy data.

The idea was to use this in a web application to allow users to select their make/model of car and calculate the cost of a trip.

There are trip cost calculators on the web but you have to know the fuel economy of your car.

It would be cool to use Google maps API as well and automatically calculate the distance between trip start and end.

Also if possible could pull fuel price from an API.

Is there a fuel economy API? fueleconomy.gov?
